Well. I've had a blog, it was German. I tried to tell people how it was growing up at Boarding School in England, but apparently boarding school in England is very time-consuming, so I didn't have much time to tell others.. Anyway, I know work in London, Software Engineering, WebOps and all that jazz for a great corporation. (No, really, we get free coffee!)

Whenever I feel like there's something that may be of interest to the outside world I shall put it on here. We'll see, let's hope this works better than last time I attempted to blog!
